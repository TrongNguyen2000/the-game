# The-Game: Structure and WorkFlow. 14 Jan 2021

Hey everyone, I added a little structure to our project in hopes that it will help with workflow and communication. 
I will post this in the  group Discussion board once it is up.

### WIKI: You all are added as collaborators on this repo. So you should be able to edit the wiki. I went ahead and chose machine learning. If anyone is opposed we can change it.
 
I put the machine learning wiki link at the end of my entry so you can pull info from the same source if you so choose.


## TODO:

  ADD PARAGRAPH OR TWO TO WIKI FILE
  
  DOWNLOAD ALL THE HTML FILES FROM theGaryLarson/the-game
  
  FILL IN THE AREAS IN YOUR HTML SOURCE CODE THAT ARE LABELED WITH COMMENTS (will see when you open your html source code)
  
  PERFORM A PULL REQUEST OFF OF theGaryLarson/the-game
  
  CONFIRM WITH GARY THAT HE SEES IT
      
    COMPLETING ALL THESE STEPS WILL GET YOU AN "A"
 ##
  
## OVERALL WORKFLOW:

Everyone should download all the html files under theGaryLarson/the-game.
All the pages are linked together and stubbed out for you to fill in with your thing and description. This will become clearer when you view your source code for the html file.

Open index.html and navigate with the links. So you see how everything connects.
Focus on getting the basics of your  page filled out

Submit a Pull Request.

If you want to take it further and add complexity feel free. 
Whatever script or complexity you add to your page shouldn't affect another page unless you tell it to.
Keep in mind if it affects another group members page get permission and work with them on what you would like to do.

Once you have made changes to your .html file do a pull request.
BRANCH: theGaryLarson/the-game branch
